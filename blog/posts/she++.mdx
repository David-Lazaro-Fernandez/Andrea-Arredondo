On October 22nd, at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus León, I had the privilege of being a speaker at the much-anticipated 5th edition of #She++. This empowering event is dedicated entirely to women in programming, providing them with a platform to excel. Alongside engaging talks, participants immersed themselves in data workshops, web development sessions, and block-coding activities.

I am deeply grateful to Estefania Saucedo Tamayo and the entire organizing team for extending their invitation to me. It was truly an honor to be part of an event that nurtures and celebrates women's contributions in the tech world. The enthusiasm and dedication displayed by all the attendees were nothing short of inspiring.

#She++ is a significant initiative that paves the way for future role models in the field of programming and technology. It serves as a reminder that we can all be agents of change, breaking barriers and empowering the next generation of young girls and teenagers. Together, we can create a more inclusive and diverse tech community, where every voice is heard, and every idea is valued. I am hopeful that this event will continue to thrive, making a lasting impact on the lives of aspiring women in tech.
